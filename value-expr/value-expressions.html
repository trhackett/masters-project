<h2>Value Categories</h2>
</div>

<p>
The c++ standard specifies that An expression is a
sequence of operators and operands that specifies a
computation. An expression can result in a value and
can cause side effects. Expressions can be as simple
as <code>i++;</code> and as complicated as <code>[]
(double d, S s)->Prime { d += 7+5+3+2; return
s.compute(d,d*2,d*3,d*5,d*7); }</code>.

Every c++ expression is defined by two independent things:
<em>type</em> and <em>value category</em>. Since you have a lot
of experience working with type, this lab focuses on value
category, a concept with which you've likely interacted very
little.
</p>

<p>
The most straight-forward way to tackle value categories is to
first look at the assignment operator, so a program like the following
very simple one will be instructive:
</p>

  <pre>
  int i;
  i = 10; // i.operator=(10);
  </pre>

<p>
When the assignment operator is invoked, there is a clear left
side (<code>i</code>) and right side (<code>10</code>). Each side is
a distinct expression, and therefore has its own type (which could be
the same) and its own value category. Given this, we'll break expressions
down into <em>glvalues</em> and <em>rvalues</em>. You may be wondering
why the first branch here wouldn't be into r(ight)values and l(eft)values.
Well for one we're going to defer the name <em>lvalue</em> for a later branch,
you'll see. For two, the name <em>lvalue</em> actually refers to C++'s
predecessor: C, which defined expressions to be <em>lvalues</em> and
everything else. In this paradigm, the right hand side would define some
computation and the left hand side would define some location to store
the result in.
</p>

<p>
When c++ came around, it turned functions into <em>lvalues</em> (gave them an
addressable location) and brought references into the picture. Function
<em>lvalues</em> was an important shift because it allowed us to use and
pass around pointers to them. References are an important concept
int c++ (hopefully you already have some idea why) but they bind to lvalues,
rather than rvalues. Expanding on the code above paints a picture:

  <pre>
  int i;
  i = 10;        // operator=(int),  i is lvalue,    10 is rvalue
  int& iRef = i; // operator=(int&), iRef is lvalue, i is lvalue
  </pre>

Up until c++11, this was fine, it was everything we needed: <em>lvalues</em>
and <em>rvalues</em> were sufficient to define the value category of every
possible expression. But when <em>move semantics</em> and <em>rvalue
references</em> came into the picture, there was a whole category of
expressions that no longer fit cleanly into <em>lvalue</em> or
<em>rvalue</em>, but kind of was both. Let's look at a motivating example. 
</p>

<pre>
  struct S {
    // lots of dynamically allocated data
    S() { ... }
    S(const S& other) { ... }
    S(S&& other) { ... }
    ~S() { ... }

  };

  S& func1() {
    static S s; // static because (note 1)
    // do some computation, build up s,
    // s is really big
    return s;
  }

  S&& func2() {
    S s;
    // do some computation, build up s,
    // s is really big
    return std::move(s);
  }


  int main() {
    S s_copy = func1();
    S s_move = func2();
  }
</pre>

<p>
When the call to <code>func1</code> is made and the result stored into
<code>s_copy</code>, the following happens: the body of <code>func1</code>
executes returning an object of type <code>S</code>, the copy constructor
for <code>S</code> is called, the <code>const S&</code> argument passed in
being the object created by <code>func1</code>, the body of the copy
constructor executes making a copy of what <code>func1</code> had created,
and <code>s</code> is destroyed. Effectively, the object that we want is being
created two times: once by <code>func1</code> and then again by the copy
constructor.
</p>

<p>
C++11 fixed this with <strong>move semantics</strong>, which avoids making
copies of objects with dynamically allocated memory in the case that we
only want one variable (<code>lvalue</code>) refering to that object. When
the call to <code>func2</code> is made, the following happens: the body
of <code>func2</code> executes returning an <strong>rvalue reference</strong>
effectively calling a different <code>S</code> constructor - the move
constructor, <code>s</code> is destroyed. The move constructor, rather than
making deep copies of all
of that dynamically allocated memory, simply has <code>s_move</code>'s
pointers point to that memory (and has <code>s</code>'s pointers point to
<code>nullptr</code> to prevent it from deallocating that data when it is
destroyed).
</p>

<p>
But what does all of this have to do with value categories? Well move semantics
introduced a new type: an <em>rvalue reference</em>
(<code><strong>&&</strong></code>). These aren't exactly just <em>rvalues</em>
because they have an addressible location in memory but they aren't
exactly just <em>lvalues</em> because they disappear after use. As soon as
<code>s</code> from <code>func2</code> has been moved into s_move, <code>s
</code> refers no longer exists. Because of this, c++11 introduced a third
value category, <em>xvalue</em>. As before, each category is mutually exclusive
 - no expression can belong to more than one at a time. We've branched our
previous {<em>lvalue</em>,<em>rvalue</em>} categories into the following:
{<em>lvalue</em>,<em>xvalue</em>,<em>prvalue</em>}.
</p>

<pre>
        expression
        /        \
     glvalue   rvalue
      /   \    /   \
 lvalue   xvalue   prvalue
</pre>

<p class=p.small>
The strict definitions of these are as follows (from the c++ standard):<br>
- A <strong>glvalue</strong> is an expression whose evaluation determines the identity
of an object, bit-field, or function.<br>
- An <strong>rvalue</strong> is a prvalue or an xvalue.<br>
- A <strong>prvalue</strong> is an expression whose evaluation initializes an object or
a bit-field, or computes the value of the operand of an operator, as
specified by the context in which it appears.<br>
- An <strong>xvalue</strong> is a glvalue that denotes an object or bit-field whose
resources can be reused (usually because it is near the end of its
lifetime). [ Example: Certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue
references yield xvalues, such as a call to a function whose
return type is an rvalue reference or a cast to an rvalue reference
type. -end example ]<br>
- An <strong>lvalue</strong> is a glvalue that is not an xvalue.<br>
</p>

<p><br><br>
<strong><em>note 1</em></strong>: this example is somewhat contrived and probably not the best
motivating example for move semantics but it gets to the point. When
the object of type <code>S</code> in <code>func1</code> is declared
<code>static</code>, it persists outside of the function call. This
prohibits c++ from performing <strong>copy elision</strong> in, which
it only calls the default constructor one time, the result being referred
automatically by the variable s_copy as opposed to calling the default
constructor, making an object for <code>s</code>, returning it into
the copy constructor that makes a copy of <code>s</code> for <code>
s_copy</code>.
