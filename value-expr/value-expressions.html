<h2>Value Categories</h2>
</div>

<p>
The c++ standard specifies that <em>"An expression is a
sequence of operators and operands that specifies a
computation"</em>. An expression can result in a value and
can cause side effects. Expressions can be as simple
as <code>i++;</code> and as complicated as <code>[]
(double d, S s) -> Prime { d += 7+5+3+2; return
s.compute(d,d*2,d*3,d*5,d*7); }</code>.

Every c++ expression is defined by two independent things:
<em>type</em> and <em>value category</em>. Since you have a lot
of experience working with type, this lab focuses on value
category, a concept with which you've likely interacted very
little.
</p>

<p>
The most straight-forward way to tackle value categories is to
first look at the assignment operator, and a program like the following
very simple one will be instructive:
</p>

  <pre>
  int i;
  i = 10; // i.operator=(10);
  </pre>

<p>
When the assignment operator is invoked, there is a clear left
side (<code>i</code>) and right side (<code>10</code>). Each side is
a distinct expression, and therefore has its own type (which, if the two
types are not the same, some conversion needs to happen) and its own value
category. Given this, we'll break expressions
down into <em>glvalues</em> and <em>rvalues</em>. You may be wondering
why the first branch here wouldn't be into r(ight)values and l(eft)values.
Well for one we're going to defer the name <em>lvalue</em> for a later branch,
you'll see. For two, the name <em>lvalue</em> actually refers to C++'s
predecessor: C, which defined expressions to be <em>lvalues</em> and
everything else. In this paradigm, the right hand side would define some
computation and the left hand side would define some location to store
the result in.
</p>

<p>
When c++ came around, it turned functions into <em>lvalues</em> (gave them an
addressable location) and brought references (&) into the picture. Functions as
<em>lvalues</em> was an important shift because it allowed us to use and
pass around pointers to them. References are an important concept
in c++ (hopefully you already have some idea why) but they bind to lvalues,
rather than rvalues. Expanding on the code above paints a picture:

  <pre>
  int i;
  i = 10;        // operator=(int),  i is lvalue,    10 is rvalue
  int& iRef = i; // operator=(int&), iRef is lvalue, i is lvalue
  </pre>

Up until c++11, this was fine, it was everything we needed: <em>lvalues</em>
and <em>rvalues</em> were sufficient to define the value category of every
possible expression. But when <em>move semantics</em> and <em>rvalue
references</em> came into the picture, there was a whole category of
expressions that no longer fit cleanly into <em>lvalue</em> or
<em>rvalue</em>, but kind of was both. Let's look at a motivating example. 
</p>

<pre>
  struct S {
      // lots of 
    S() { ... }                   // line A
    S(const S& other) { ... }     // line B
    S(S&& other) { ... }          // line C
    ~S() { ... }

  };

  S& func1() {                    // line D
    static S s; // (note 1)       -- invokes line A
      // do some computation,
      // build up s,
      // s is really big
    return s;                     // invokes line B
  }

  S&& func2() {                   // line E
    S s;                          // invokes line A
      // do some computation,
      // build up s,
      // s is really big
    return std::move(s);          // invokes line C
  }


  int main() {
    S s_copy = func1();           // invokes line D
    S s_move = func2();           // invokes line E
  }
</pre>

<p>
When the call to <code>func1</code> is made in the main function and the result stored into
<code>s_copy</code>, the following happens: the body of <code>func1</code>
executes returning an object of type <code>S</code>, the copy constructor
for <code>S</code> is called (note 1 for details) - the <code>const S&</code> argument passed in
being the object created by <code>func1</code>, the body of the copy
constructor executes making a copy of what <code>func1</code> had created.
Effectively, the object that we want is being
created two times: once by <code>func1</code> and then again by the copy
constructor. If the goal of <code>func1()</code> is to create an object but have only the
variable <code>s_copy</code> refer to that object, then this code is very
wasteful. Assuming the building up of an <code>S</code> object is expensive,
this operation has to wastefully happen twice.
</p>

<p>
C++11 fixed this with <strong>move semantics</strong>, which avoids making
copies of objects with dynamically allocated memory in the case that a variable
is about to be destroyed but before it does, we
only want another variable (<code>lvalue</code>) to refer to to that object. When
the call to <code>func2</code> is made, the following happens: the body
of <code>func2</code> executes returning an <strong>rvalue reference</strong>
effectively calling a different <code>S</code> constructor - the move
constructor, <code>s</code> within <code>func2()</code> is destroyed.
The move constructor, rather than making deep copies of all
of that dynamically allocated memory, simply has <code>s_move</code>'s internal
pointers point to that memory (and has <code>s</code>'s pointers point to
<code>nullptr</code> to prevent it from freeing the data when it is
destroyed).
</p>

<p>
But what does all of this have to do with value categories? Well move semantics
introduced a new type: an <em>rvalue reference</em>
(<code><strong>&&</strong></code>). These aren't exactly just <em>rvalues</em>
because they have an addressible location in memory but they aren't
exactly just <em>lvalues</em> because they disappear after use. As soon as
<code>s</code> from <code>func2</code> has been moved into s_move, <code>s
</code> refers no longer exists. Because of this, c++11 introduced a third
value category, <em>xvalue</em>. As before, each category is mutually exclusive
 - no expression can belong to more than one at a time. We've branched our
previous {<em>lvalue</em>,<em>rvalue</em>} categories into the following:
{<em>lvalue</em>,<em>xvalue</em>,<em>prvalue</em>}.
</p>

<pre>
        expression
        /        \
     glvalue   rvalue
      /   \    /   \
 lvalue   xvalue   prvalue
</pre>

<p class=p.small>
The strict definitions of these are as follows (from the c++ standard):<br>
- A <strong>glvalue</strong> is an expression whose evaluation determines the identity
of an object, bit-field, or function.<br>
- An <strong>rvalue</strong> is a prvalue or an xvalue.<br>
- A <strong>prvalue</strong> is an expression whose evaluation initializes an object or
a bit-field, or computes the value of the operand of an operator, as
specified by the context in which it appears.<br>
- An <strong>xvalue</strong> is a glvalue that denotes an object or bit-field whose
resources can be reused (usually because it is near the end of its
lifetime). [ Example: Certain kinds of expressions involving rvalue
references yield xvalues, such as a call to a function whose
return type is an rvalue reference or a cast to an rvalue reference
type. -end example ]<br>
- An <strong>lvalue</strong> is a glvalue that is not an xvalue.<br>

<p><br><br>
<strong><em>note 1</em></strong>: this example is somewhat contrived and probably not the best
motivating example for move semantics but it gets to the point. When
the object of type <code>S</code> in <code>func1</code> is declared
<code>static</code>, it persists outside of the function call. This
prohibits c++ from performing <strong>copy elision</strong> in, which
it only calls the default constructor one time, the result being referred
automatically by the variable s_copy as opposed to calling the default
constructor, making an object for <code>s</code>, returning it into
the copy constructor that makes a copy of <code>s</code> for <code>
s_copy</code>.
