  One of the biggest and most nuanced challenges a C++ developer faces is
  managing allocated memory in their programs. Even the most beginner of
  programmers knows that every call to <code>new</code> must have an
  accompanying call to <code>delete</code> or else their code will leak
  memory. A program with heavy memory requirements that runs for any
  kind of duration (think browsers, games, text editors, any persisting
  program on your machine) needs to be very careful about the memory
  it allocates so that it doesn't blow up the machine's RAM and prevent
  other programs from starting up and running efficiently.
</p>

<p>
  This lab is an exercise in careful programming. The goal is two-fold: 1. we
  want to develop a pointer class that handles memory allocation (calls to
  <code>new</code>) and de-allocation (calls to <code>delete</code>) and 2. we
  want to write a memory-intensive program that replaces all raw
  pointers (<code>*</code>) with our pointer class so that we don't have to 
  worry about leaking memory.
</p>

<p>
  Note that C++ already did this for us. The C++11 standard created the
  <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>shared_ptr</code> interfaces that make
  certain memory guarantees. Our goal here is not to replace those interfaces
  nor is it to come up with a better system of managing memory. Our goal is
  to create an interface that acts exactly like a raw pointer does with the
  additional functionality that it calls delete for us when the memory is
  no longer being used.
</p>

<h3>Part1</h3>

<h4><code>LeaklessPtr&lt;T, Impl&gt;&gt;</code></h4>

<p>
  Our leak-proof pointer class template is called <code>LeaklessPtr</code>
  and it defines two templates: <code>T</code>, the type object this
  pointer points to, and <code>SelfishPtrImpl</code>, a class template
  for a polymorphic implementation of the <code>LeaklessPtr</code>
  class template. The <code>Leakless</code> employs the <strong>pImpl</strong>
  idiom: it stores a pointer to some other class that handles the major
  functionality of the pointer itself. This class provides the
  following interface:
</p>

<pre>
template<class T, template<class> class Impl>
class LeaklessPtr {
public:
  using AllocFunc = T* (*) ();
  using FreeFunc = void (*) (T*);

  // the main constructor utilized by this class: it
  // takes in a pointer to some allocation function
  // (that calls new) and some de-allocation function
  // (that calls delete). The constructor has its
  // implementation allocate a new object of type T
  // and maintains the pointer to it
  LeaklessPtr(AllocFunc aFunc, FreeFunc fFunc);

  // the copy constructor and assignment operator are defined
  // for LeaklessPtr, which if you know about unique_ptr, this
  // may come as a shock. Since you can copy raw pointers, we'll
  // say you can also copy LeaklessPtrs. More implementation
  // details below
  LeaklessPtr(LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>& other);
  LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>& operator=(LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>& rhs);

  // the move constructor moves the resources pointer to by
  // mover's implementation to me - at the end of this function
  // mover == nullptr should return true and *this == nullptr
  // should return false. DON'T LEAK MEMORY
  LeaklessPtr(LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>&& mover);

  // this function frees the memory we allocated, if there is any
  ~LeaklessPtr();

  // everything a normal raw pointer provides - defer the work to
  // your implementation so we can change it easily
  T& operator*() const;
  T* operator->() const;
  T& operator[](int offset) const;
  bool operator==(const T* other) const;
  bool operator!=(const T* other) const;
  bool operator==(const LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>& other) const;
  bool operator!=(const LeaklessPtr<T,Impl>& other) const;
  T* operator+(int offset) const;
  T* operator-(int offset) const;

private:
  // your implementation pointer here
};
</pre>

<p>
  You may be wondering who we take in a template <code>Impl</code> if
  we are going to store a pointer to the implementation. Well, we want
  to combine C++'s polymorphic promises with what pImpl can provide.
  Specifically, you should define some abstract base implementation class
  that provides the functionality that every raw pointer provides - leaving
  it to you to decide exactly what that includes. Meanwhile, Impl should
  be some class that derives from this abstract base classes and provides 
  additional functionality. You'll find that to be very little for the
  first implementation, <code>SelfishPtrImpl</code>.
</p>

<h4><code>Implementation</code> specifics</h4>

<h5><code>SelfishPtrImpl&lt;T&gt;</code></h5>

<p>
  The <code>SelfishPtrImpl</code> implementation of <code>LeaklessPtr</code>
  is just that - selfish. It demands, requires in fact, that it is the
  one and only things pointing to the allocated object at any given point
  in time. It's constructor should allocate the memory and point to it.
  It demands that it be the only one to call the free function on that
  object that it allocated. Because we are providing copy functionality,
  we'll say that <code>SelfishPtrImpl</code>s can steal from one another,
  acting much like the <em>move constructor</em>.
  Outside of you implementation classes (a base class is ok), you must
  never explicitly call <code>new</code> or <code>delete</code>.
  You must pass in to the constructor some lambda function that makes
  the calls for you and have the implementation make the calls. 
</p>

<h5><code>AltrusticPtrImpl&lt;T&gt;</code></h5>

<p>
  The <code>AltruisticPtrImpl</code> is much kinder than the <code>
  SelfishPtrImpl</code>, it is always willing to share the object
  that it points to. It wouldn't steal resources - but it is willing
  to give its resources away when asked to. To be more
  technical, just like the <code>SelfishPtrImpl</code>, it's constructor
  must take in an allocation function and a freeing function - it
  allocates (or has some base class allocate) an object of type
  <code>T</code>. To copy, it shares the object it points to,
  letting the left-hand side of the call point to its object. When
  asked to <em>move</em>, it gives away the pointer to another
  <code>AltruisticPtrImpl</code>. Of course, it would never leak
  memory, so you must come up with a scheme for knowing whether or
  not you are the last referece to the object.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Important</strong>: Running <code>make main; ./main</code> should
  print <code>"Passed all tests!"</code> and running <code>make mem-test</code>
  should report 0 memory leaks. Before moving on to the next part, you
  should be absolutely sure no memory is leaked, includig writing your
  own tests if you have to.
</p>

<h3>Part 2 Simple Road Simulator</h3>

<p>
  Now we're going to write an application that heavily relies on <code>LeaklessPtr</code>s
  to see some of the benefit. Specifically, we're going to write a simple simulator
  of a road network with cars flowing through it. No one likes to sit in traffic and
  everyone wants to take the fastest route from point A to point B. Unfortunately if
  everyone took the same route, there would be so much congestion no one would ever
  make it their destination (see the 405 mere blocks from campus for an illustration).
  We'd like to figure out the best way to get a number of cars to their destination in
  on average the fastest time possible. We already know that A* search which gives us
  complexity exponential to the depth of the solution (even better with a reasonable
  heuristic) and allows us to specify which factors effect the routing decision using
  different heuristic functions.
</p>

<p>
  In order to explore which heurstics give us the best performance, we need to some
  reproducible setting in which we can test out some heuristics. So we'd like a
  simulator that can specify the density of cars (rate at which they enter the
  simulation), their movement (how many can leave an intersection), a route
  computation algorithm, and a heuristic for that algorithm. That way, by varying
  these parameters, we can evaluate how well each heurstic performs in different
  settings.
</p>

<p>
  To simulate a network of roads and vehicles moving through it, we'll make the
  reduction that the network is a two-dimensional grid of intersections. It takes
  one "iteration" of the simulation for each car to move from one intersection to
  another. Each intersection can hold an infinite number of cars.
</p>

<p>
  The specification for your simulator is intentionally simple and vague. You
  should use your now exceptional C++ skills to design the simulator. A few key
  requirements:
</p>

<ol>
  <il>
    <p>a. it must not store or use ANY raw pointers.</p>
  </il>

  <il>
    <p>b. it must leak no memory.</p>
  </il>

  <il>
    <p>c. your <code>Simulation</code> class must be constructed with the
    following integers:</p>
    <ul>
      <il>
        <p class=p.small>
          - <code>numRows,numCols</code>: number of rows/columns in the network
          (<em><code>(numRows*numCols)</code> is the number of intersections</em>)<br>
          - <code>startRow,startCol</code>: row/column each car enters on<br>
          - <code>endRow,endCol</code>: row/column each car exits on<br>
          - <code>carRate</code>: insert this many new cars each iteration
          interations<br>
          - <code>numIterations</code>: number of iterations the simulation
          goes through
          - <code>carMovement</code>: number of cars that can leave each intersection
          per iteration
        </p>
      </il>
    </ul>
  </il>

  <il>
    <p>d. You Simulation class should support the provided driver program that
    runs it: <strong>simulate.cpp</strong></p>
  </il>

  <il>
    <p>
      e. At the end of the simulation, it should print out the average amount
      of time (in ms) it took each car to successfully get from
      startRow,startCol to endRow,endCol. Any cars that didn't
      make it don't get factored into the statistic. Be sure you factor out the
      time it takes to compute the route, we can assume each car has an impossibly
      fast processor so can perform any route computation immediately.
      It's very rudimentary.
    </p>
  </il>

  <il>
    <p>f. You must use Professor Smallberg's Timer class (<strong>timer.h</strong>) 
    so we have consistent results between students.</p>
  </il>
</ol>

<p>
  Each iteration, at most carMovement cars per intersection can move to an adjactent
  intersection. Cars can only move in one of four directions: 
  <code>Up</code>, <code>Right</code>, <code>Down</code>, or <code>Left</code>. 
  To compute the
  optimal move, each car must use <em>A* search</em> each iteration. You can write your own
  and vary
  which heuristic function they use to compute the <code>h</code> value of each intersection.
  Heuristic functions take the following form:
</p>

<pre>
      // returns a double, takes in coordinates of an intersection
      // and a const reference to the simulation
    double heuristic(int row, int col, <strong>const</strong> Simulation& sim);
</pre>

<p>An interation of the simulation consists of the following:</p>
<ol><il>
  <p class=p.small>
    - potentially inserting a new car<br>
    - moving carMovement cars per intersection (in a direction the car computes)<br>
    - removing the car from the simulation if it's reached the end<br>
  </p>
</il></ol>

<p>Once the simulation is over it should return the average time it took the cars to
get from startRow,startCol to endRow,endCol. Remember to factor out the time it
takes to compute the route or else you find some heuristics perform arbitrarily
better than some other smarter heuristic.</p>

<p>
  This simulation is admittedly rudimentary. Once you've got it working and
  it leaks no memory, here are fun directions you can take it in:
</p>
  <ol><il>
  <p class=p.small>
    - heuristics: which ones can you think of that get cars there the fastest?<br>
    - traffic model: it's unlikely that intersections can actually support an
    infinite number of cars. It could be interesting to block off full intersections.
    <br>
    - accident simulation: what happens if there is an accident at an intersection
    and none of the cars can move? How would they factor that into their route.<br>
    - actual roads: instead of this 2D grid of intersections, can you confure up
    a way for the simulator to look like actual roads with distances and times to
    get from one to another. We make the strong assumption here that it takes the same
    amount of time to get from one intersection to an adjacent on, which is not
    true in real life. It would be interesting to make a more accurate model.<br>
  </p>
</il></ol>
