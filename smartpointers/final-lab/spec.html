    <h2>Memory Lab</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    This lab is broadly about memory management in c++; creating and working with
    multiple, templated, interacting classes; and combining language features to
    produce a general, extendible product. The final goal is to produce simple
    simulator for a road network. In this network, cars have a single point of entry
    and a separate single point of exit. Along the way, cars use A*
    to compute the best route from where they are to the end and we'll time the cars
    on various heuristics to see which seems to be working the best.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we get more into the specifics of the simulator and its behavior, we want
    to be absolutely sure that it doesn't leak memory. Even if this comes with some
    runtime cost, we'll say that's ok since a simulation that leaks memory is going to
    affect the performance of the entire machine running it. To ensure that no memory
    leaks, we're going to say that the simulator isn't allowed to store any raw pointers.
    To keep track of it's data, it must hold the pointers in a memory management
    class that (<em>surprise</em>) you're going to write.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 1 Not-So-Smart Pointers</h3>

  <h4>A. <code>SmartPtr&lt;T, BasePtr&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>
    As chapter 7 of <strong>Modern C++ Design</strong> explains, making a class
    that perfectly wraps
    the functionality of a raw pointer and perfectly frees that memory is not a
    trivial task. We're going to write a class that performs a subset of the work
    c++11's unique_ptr and shared_ptr do. Specifically, your SmartPtr will not
    guarantee that an allocated object it holds will get deleted. If the user of
    your SmartPtr class misuses it, it will leak memory just like a raw pointer
    will. This may seem pointless but we specifically want this class to take care
    of allocating and freeing memory for us. We don't want to have to remember to
    call <code>delete</code> on everything that we've allocated with <code>new</code>
    because with something
    as big and complicated as a network simulator, we are bound to make mistakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your class, <code>SmartPtr</code>, mirrors raw pointers, but adds functionality
    for automatically
    <code>delete</code>ing the pointer when you're done with it. Before getting into
    implementation
    specifics, this is how <code>SmartPtr</code>'s behave generally:
  </p>

  <pre>
    // the user of a SmartPtr should never explicitly call
    // new or delete - SmartPtr takes care of that for us
  string* allocString()       { return new string; }
  void freeString(string* s)  { delete s; }

  int* allocIntArray()        { return new int[10]; }
  void freeIntArray(int* i)   { delete [] i; }

  int main() {
      // when initialized, SmartPtrs allocate the memory and
      // remember how to delete it
    SmartPtr<string, BasePtr> sptr(&allocString, &freeString);

      // we can use SmartPtrs like raw pointers
    *sptr = "tyrion";
    assert(sptr->size() == 6);
    assert((*sptr)[3] == 'i');

    SmartPtr<string, BaesPtr> sptr1(&allocString, &freeString);
    *sptr1 = "tyrion";
    assert(sptr1 != sptr);
    assert(*sptr1 == *sptr);

      // you can also allocate arrays
    SmartPtr<int, BasePtr> intarrptr(&allocIntArray, &freeIntArray);

    intarrptr[0] = 10;
    intarrptr[1] = 20;
    assert((*intarrptr) + (*(intarrptr + 1)) == 30);

    int* intptr = intarrptr + 2;
    *intptr = 30;
    assert(intarrptr[0] + intarrptr[1] + intarrptr[2] == 60);

    cout << "Passed all tests!" << endl;
  }
  </pre>

  <p>
    All <code>SmartPtr</code>s provide the same functionality as raw pointers,
    meaning the above code
    with your <code>SmartPtr</code> and <code>BasePtr</code> classes should
    compile and print "<strong>Passed all tests!</strong>"
    when run. On top of that, it shouldn't leak memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    You probably noticed that <code>SmartPtr</code> have two template arguments.
    The <code>SmartPtr</code >is a
    <code>templated</code> class that stores a pointer to an object of some type,
    but it also stores an
    implementation (well, a pointer to some implementation) that does all the real work.
    There are a multitude of ways a <code>SmartPtr</code> can be implemented and
    function. From here,
    we'll focus on cheaply imitating the two c++11 provides: <code>unique_ptr</code> and
    <code>shared_ptr</code>. On the surface the difference is simple, only one
    <code>unique_ptr</code> can point
    to a particular object while any number of <code>shared_ptr</code> can point to an object.
  </p>

  <h4>B. <code>SmartPtr&lt;T, UniquePtr&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>
    As we've said, a <code>UniquePtr</code> is the only <code>UniquePtr</code>
    that points to the allocated object
    it points to. If the user of your <code>UniquePtr</code> class also stores a
    raw pointer that
    points to the same thing some <code>UniquePtr</code> points to, they are
    taking a huge risk. For
    example, if they <code>delete</code> that object, your class should guarantee a double deletion.
  </p>

  <p>
    On top of the functions <code>BasePtr</code> provides, <code>UniquePtr</code>
    should support the following public
    interface. The class structure of <code>Base</code>/<code>Unique</code>/
    <code>SharedPtr</code> is up to you. If you need to
    make minor changes (add <code>virtual</code> or <code>override</code>) to
    this interface to support that,
    that's up to you. But these functions must be supported for an object
    of type <code>SmartPtr&lt;T, UniquePtr&gt;</code>.
  </p>

  <pre>
      // Default constructor points to some garbage value
      // like raw pointers, this allows us to keep containers
      // of UniquePtrs. If you default construct a UniquePtr and
      // want it to point to something later, you must use the
      // reset function. The danger is if you re-assign a default
      // constructed UniquePtr, there is no delete function to call
      // on that memory - user beware!
    UniquePtr();

      // Construct with some allocated memory (a pointer to it)
      // and a mechanism for deleting that memory
    UniquePtr(T* obj, void (*deleteFunc) (T*));

      // Construct with just a deletion function
    UniquePtr(void (*) (T*));

      // Copy contructor: this steals the object and delete
      // function from other (not const)
    UniquePtr(UniquePtr<T>& other);

      // Move constructor for temporary values that are passed in to
      // a constructor, transfers ownership over to me (this), so mover
      // can no longer point to the object when this function returns
    UniquePtr(UniquePtr<T>&& mover);

      // Clean up the memory by calling the delete function you
      // were given
    ~UniquePtr();

      // Assignment operator (have it point to something new): clears
      // what this pointed to before and sets it to point to rhs's
      // object of the same type. The other UniquePtr then must NOT point
      // to that same object.
    UniquePtr<T>& operator=(UniquePtr<T>& rhs);

      // should also be able to reassign it to new memory
    void reset(T* obj, void (*deleteFunc) (T*));

      // Only ever one pointer to that object.
    int getNumReferences() const;
  </pre>

  <p>
    The move constructor is called when an object is initialized using 
    <code>std::move</code>
    or as the return value of a function returning a <code>SmartPtr</code>.
    For more information,
    read <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/move_constructor">
    Move Constructor</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can add any private functionality that you need.
  </p>

  <h4>C. <code>SmartPtr&lt;T, SharedPtr&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>
    A <code>SharedPtr</code> can point to an object that is pointed to by
    any number of other <code>SharedPtrs</code>. There are multiple ways to
    provide this functionality (see <em>Modern C++ Design</em> chapter 7 for
    more details about the trade offs) but we are going
    to implement a Reference Count. Each <code>SharedPtr</code> should know the
    number of other <code>SharedPtrs</code> pointing to the same object. Again,
    the class and inheritance
    structure is up to you, as long as the following public interface is specified:
  </p>

  <pre>
      // default constructor has it point to nothing and initializes
      // the reference count
    SharedPtr();

      // point to obj and remember how to delete it
    SharedPtr(T* obj, void (*deleteFunc) (T*));

      // Copy Constructor - have this point to what
      // other points to and updatees the reference count
    SharedPtr(SharedPtr& other);

      // Move/Steal constructor. You're effectively moving the
      // pointer from mover to this. So at the end, mover no longer
      // points to the object and the reference count hasn't changed
      // since you've removed one pointer and added another (x+1-1=x).
    SharedPtr(SharedPtr&& mover);

      // Destructor: this no longer points to its object
    ~SharedPtr();

      // Assignment operator: this no longer points to its object, and
      // now shares a pointer with rhs.
    SharedPtr& operator=(SharedPtr& rhs);
    
      // this no longer points to its object and now points to a newly
      // allocated object wih a new reference count
    void reset(T* obj, void (*deleteFunc) (T*));

      // returns the number of references to the object this points
      // to. If it's an invalid reference (has been moved to another),
      // then return -1.
    int getNumReferences() const;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Once you've finished implementing <code>SmartPtr</code>, <code>UniquePtr</code>,
    and <code>SharedPtr</code>, you should ensure it passes all of the tests in ptr-test.cpp.
  </p>

  <h3>Part 2 Simple Road Simulator</h3>

  <p>
    Now we're going to write an application that heavily relies on <code>SmartPtr</code>s
    to see some of the benefit. Specifically, we're going to write a simple simulator
    of a road network with cars flowing through it. No one likes to sit in traffic and
    everyone wants to take the fastest route from point A to point B. Unfortunately if
    everyone took the same route, there would be so much congestion no one would ever
    make it their destination (see the 405 mere blocks from campus for an illustration).
    We'd like to figure out the best way to get a number of cars to their destination in
    on average the fastest time possible. We already know that A* search which gives us
    complexity exponential to the depth of the solution (even better with a reasonable
    heuristic) and allows us to specify which factors effect the routing decision using
    different heuristic functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to explore which heurstics give us the best performance, we need to some
    reproducible setting in which we can test out some heuristics. So we'd like a
    simulator that can specify the density of cars (rate at which they enter the
    simulation), their movement (how many can leave an intersection), a route
    computation algorithm, and a heuristic for that algorithm. That way, by varying
    these parameters, we can evaluate how well each heurstic performs in different
    settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    To simulate a network of roads and vehicles moving through it, we'll make the
    reduction that the network is a two-dimensional grid of intersections. It takes
    one "iteration" of the simulation for each car to move from one intersection to
    another. Each intersection can hold an infinite number of cars.
  </p>

  <p>
    The specification for your simulator is intentionally simple and vague. You
    should use your now exceptional C++ skills to design the simulator. A few key
    requirements:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <il>
      <p>a. it must not store or use ANY raw pointers.</p>
    </il>

    <il>
      <p>b. it must leak no memory.</p>
    </il>

    <il>
      <p>c. your <code>Simulation</code> class must be constructed with the
      following integers:</p>
      <ul>
        <il>
          <p class=p.small>
            - <code>numRows,numCols</code>: number of rows/columns in the network
            (<em><code>(numRows*numCols)</code> is the number of intersections</em>)<br>
            - <code>startRow,startCol</code>: row/column each car enters on<br>
            - <code>endRow,endCol</code>: row/column each car exits on<br>
            - <code>carRate</code>: insert this many new cars each iteration
            interations<br>
            - <code>numIterations</code>: number of iterations the simulation
            goes through
            - <code>carMovement</code>: number of cars that can leave each intersection
            per iteration
          </p>
        </il>
      </ul>
    </il>

    <il>
      <p>d. You Simulation class should support the provided driver program that
      runs it: <strong>simulate.cpp</strong></p>
    </il>

    <il>
      <p>
        e. At the end of the simulation, it should print out the average amount
        of time (in ms) it took each car to successfully get from
        startRow,startCol to endRow,endCol. Any cars that didn't
        make it don't get factored into the statistic. Be sure you factor out the
        time it takes to compute the route, we can assume each car has an impossibly
        fast processor so can perform any route computation immediately.
        It's very rudimentary.
      </p>
    </il>

    <il>
      <p>f. You must use Professor Smallberg's Timer class (<strong>timer.h</strong>) 
      so we have consistent results between students.</p>
    </il>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Each iteration, at most carMovement cars per intersection can move to an adjactent
    intersection. Cars can only move in one of four directions: 
    <code>Up</code>, <code>Right</code>, <code>Down</code>, or <code>Left</code>. 
    To compute the
    optimal move, each car must use <em>A* search</em> each iteration. You can write your own
    and vary
    which heuristic function they use to compute the <code>h</code> value of each intersection.
    Heuristic functions take the following form:
  </p>

  <pre>
        // returns a double, takes in coordinates of an intersection
        // and a const reference to the simulation
      double heuristic(int row, int col, <strong>const</strong> Simulation& sim);
  </pre>

  <p>An interation of the simulation consists of the following:</p>
  <ol><il>
    <p class=p.small>
      - potentially inserting a new car<br>
      - moving carMovement cars per intersection (in a direction the car computes)<br>
      - removing the car from the simulation if it's reached the end<br>
    </p>
  </il></ol>

  <p>Once the simulation is over it should return the average time it took the cars to
  get from startRow,startCol to endRow,endCol. Remember to factor out the time it
  takes to compute the route or else you find some heuristics perform arbitrarily
  better than some other smarter heuristic.</p>

  <p>
    This simulation is admittedly rudimentary. Once you've got it working and
    it leaks no memory, here are fun directions you can take it in:
  </p>
    <ol><il>
    <p class=p.small>
      - heuristics: which ones can you think of that get cars there the fastest?<br>
      - traffic model: it's unlikely that intersections can actually support an
      infinite number of cars. It could be interesting to block off full intersections.
      <br>
      - accident simulation: what happens if there is an accident at an intersection
      and none of the cars can move? How would they factor that into their route.<br>
      - actual roads: instead of this 2D grid of intersections, can you confure up
      a way for the simulator to look like actual roads with distances and times to
      get from one to another. We make the strong assumption here that it takes the same
      amount of time to get from one intersection to an adjacent on, which is not
      true in real life. It would be interesting to make a more accurate model.<br>
    </p>
  </il></ol>
