    <h2>Memory Lab</h2>

<p>
  All of the programs you've written up to this point have
  been designed to solve some very specific problem. The
  specification details exactly what the program should do
  given all possible inputs. All you have had to do is come
  up with the best way to implement that functionality without
  error (or at least handling errors gracefully). This works
  well for learning about concepts and how to write programs
  abiding by some computer science concept. What it doesn't do
  is provide the kind of flexibility we may want. In developing
  an application that is going to be used by any number of
  developers for whatever purpose they bring to the table, we
  want to provide a program that will bend and stretch to their
  needs. Oftentimes, they will write their own classes that
  they want to fit into the framework we've provided. Take, as
  a huge scale example, the internet. Each machine connected to
  the internet can run a different operating system, run
  different applications that need to communicate to one another.
  The internet needs only provide some standardized mechanism
  for that communication.

  In this lab, you're going to write a program that is designed
  to be general. Your program will provide a back-bone that a
  developer take and extend to their purposes. The context for
  this lab is a very reduced form of the internet. The internet
  is just an enormous network of connected machines. It is a
  transporter of bits - if one machine wants to get data to another,
  it sets up a connection with that machine (by sending and
  receiving some bits), sends the data (in the form of bits),
  and closes the connection (by sending/receiving some bits).
  I repeat myself intentionally to emphasize that the interface
  is very simple and the details are what actually provide the
  functionality.
